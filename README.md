## A Spaghetti Jam - Piscine 19/10/2025 submission

Game Jam Theme: **It takes one to know one**

Our submission is a simple rhythm game.
Yes, it's not fitting the theme too well. Our idea was that "it takes a rockstar to know a rockstar", but we couldn't flesh out the idea within the alloted time.
Regardless, we are happy with the result given our prior experiences.
